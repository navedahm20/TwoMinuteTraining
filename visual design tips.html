        <h3>Visual Design Tips</h3>
        <h4>Design and Art</h4>
        <p>Design is not the same as art. Design has a purpose. It communicates a message. And it must be understood to be considered good design (if people don't get it, by definition, it's not good design). <span class="secondary-color-italic">Visual Design</span> is the organization of images and text in graphic space.
        </p>
        <h4>Sketch First</h4>
        <p>Literally sketch it. With paper and pencil. Sketching freeform gives you much more freedom to create. It doesn't have to be beautiful work of art, but it will allow you to take an idea from your mind and make it tangible and visual. Seeing your design on paper gives you a much better idea of if the design will actually work. Then, try to re-create it on the computer.</p>
        <h4>Organize Graphic Space</h4>
        <p>Create a clean organized space. Consider the background as well as the foreground. Allow enough white space in your design. Also consider symmetry. A symmetrical layout is calming and pleasing to the eye, but an asymmetrical layout will grab your learners attention more effectively.</p>
        <h4>Hierarchy</h4>
        <p>Your visual hierarch controls the order in which the learner sees the visual elements on the page. Think about what you want learners to look at first. Here are a few factors to consider:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="secondary-color-italic">Position:</span> the top and upper left  area of the page is usually looked at first</li>
                <li><span class="secondary-color-italic">Size:</span> larger items are noticed first</li>
                <li><span class="secondary-color-italic">Color:</span> brighter colors are noticed first</li>
                <li><span class="secondary-color-italic">Visual cue:</span> for example, an arrow pointing to something</li>
                <li><span class="secondary-color-italic">Numbering:</span> if you number items, number 1 is noticed first</li>
            </ul>
        <h4>Bullet Points</h4>
        <p>When it comes to learning design (or any design), bullet points usually get a bad rap, but bullet points are actually very effective. They can take a large chunk of information and break it up into smaller components which makes the content easier to digest. The problem is that bullet points are over-used (especially in eLearning). The result is that they become mind-numbing and lose their effectiveness. Here are a few ways to transform bullet points into something more engaging:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Convert bullet points into shapes (with text)</li>
                <li>If there is a lot of text, you could replace bullet points with icons</li>
                <li>If appropriate, convert bullet points into a diagram, image, or animation</li>
                <li>Reframe bullet points into questions and have the narrator answer them</li>
                <li>Shorten the text down to a word or short phrase</li>
            </ul>
