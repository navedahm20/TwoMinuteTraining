        <h3>Design That Leads To Learning</h3>
        <p>Why does training fail? It's usually due to one of three reasons: it's not designed for how people learn, it's not the correct solution to the performance issue, or,  it's not designed to teach people what to <span class="secondary-color-italic">do</span> (it cannot be only about what people need  to know).</p>
        <p>This begs the question, how do people actually learn? In a nutshell, people learn by <span class="secondary-color-italic">applying</span> knowledge, <span class="secondary-color-italic">evaluating</span> their performance, and then repeating that process over and over again. For example, let's say you're learning how to bake a cake. You don't simply watch a video on how to bake a cake and poof, you're magically able to bake a cake. After you watch the video, you actually have to bake the cake (<span class="secondary-color-italic">apply</span> the knowledge). Then, you have to eat the cake and decide if it tastes good or not (<span class="secondary-color-italic">evaluate</span> performance). Finally, taking your evaluation into consideration, you bake a cake again and re-evaluate. For example, your cake may have gotten burned so the next time you bake, you may lower the temperature or bake for a shorter period of time.
        </p>
        <p>So what's the point? The point is that learning is not an <span class="secondary-color-italic">event</span>, it's a <span class="secondary-color-italic">process</span> (training is an event, but training does not equal learning). Learning occurs through an <span class="secondary-color-italic">ecosystem of learning experiences</span>.
        </p>
        <p>Adults have certain motivations to learn (which are different than children). Adults are self-directed, which means that they don't like to be told to learn something, the motivation has to come from within. When adults do learn, they refer to past experiences. Adults are triggered to learn when things change. And they solve problems to <span class="secondary-color-italic">live in a more satisfying way</span>.</p>
        <h4>Four Principles of Adult Learning</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Adults learn when they are involved in the planning of their learning</li>
                <li>They learn through action and evaluating that action</li>
                <li>They learn when they are challenged by problems rather than just hearing solutions</li>
                <li>They learn when the content is relevant to them</li>
            </ol>
        <p>So, when is training the solution to the problem? Before we answer that, let's consider the reasons why people don't perform the way we want them to. There are four possible reasons: lack of knowledge, lack of skill, lack of motivation, or the environment.</p>
        <p>Of these four reasons, only two can be addressed with training: lack of knowledge and lack of skill.</p>
        <p>This leads to the next question, how can we figure out the cause of the performance issue? By doing a needs analysis. A needs analysis is the process of evaluating a performance issue, determing the root cause, and then offering solutions.</p>
        <p>Is it really necessary to do a needs analysis? Yes. It is. Because without it, you have no way of knowing if your solution is actually the solving the problem. You may end up creating a learning solution to a non-learning problem.</p>
        <p>A needs analysis may sound like a long and complicated process, but it's not. It's quite simply actually. A needs analysis basically asks three questions:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>What are people doing?</li>
                <li>What should they be doing?</li>
                <li>Why aren't they doing what they should be doing?</li>
            </ol>
        <p>How do you find the answers to these questions? Here are five things you can do:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Talk to stakeholders</li>
                <li>Review data</li>
                <li>Observe the people</li>
                <li>Talk to the people</li>
                <li>Review best practices</li>
            </ol>
        <p>Once you've done a needs analysis and you've determined that the solution to the problem <span class="secondary-color-italic">is</span> learning, then you can begin to design the learning experience. Here are three things to consider when you design your learning:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><span class="secondary-color-italic">Make it blended:</span> learning isn't just one thing - it's an ecosystem of learning experiences. It doesn't have to be just an eLearning course, or just a classroom training. Remember, learning is not an event, it's a process.</li>
                <li><span class="secondary-color-italic">Determine your objective:</span> what are you trying to achieve through learning?</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Transfer of knowledge</li>
                        <li>Practicing a behavior</li>
                        <li>Applying a behavior</li>
                        <li>Assessing knowledge or performance</li>
                    </ul>
                <li><span class="secondary-color-italic">Make it active:</span> remember, adults learn when they're challenged by problems, not when they just hear solutions. Technically speaking, learners don't need to <span class="secondary-color-italic">know</span> anything. They need to be able to <span class="secondary-color-italic">do</span> things.</li>
            </ol>
