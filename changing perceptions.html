        <h3>Changing How We Are Perceived</h3>
        <p>One of the presenters showed a really cool chart which illustrates how we are currently perceived by the business, and how we should be perceived. Personally, I think this is just as much about how others perceive us as it is how we perceive ourselves:</p>
    <img src="/img/perception tree.png" alt="chart that shows the perception pyramid">
    <p>The <span class="accent-color">triangle</span> basically shows how we end up being perceived. How we think influences what we say, which influences what we do, which influences how we are perceived. As the arrows indicate, the reverse is also true: how we are perceived influences what we do, which influences what we say which, influences how we think.</p>
    <p>The <span class="secondary-color">red shapes</span> show (for the most part, I think) our current mindset. The goal in our mind is training so when we talk to the business, we talk about learners and skills. What we do is create courses. Therefore, we are perceived as trainers.</p>
    <p>The <span class="primary-color-italic">aqua shapes</span> is the shift in mindset that the presenters argue. If we shift our thinking from training to productivity, then we begin to talk about workers and their performance. What we're creating goes from courses to performance solutions and thus, how we are perceived, changes from merely trainers to problem solvers (I would also add the word consultants).</p>
    <p>I think this "tree of perception" is very relevant to us currently as it seems we are literally in the midst of trying to get the business to change how we are perceived. Let's start with shifting our mindset to focus on productivity.</p>
