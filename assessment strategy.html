        <h3>Developing an Assessment Strategy</h3>
        <p>If we are to create an assessment strategy, there are 5 questions we must answer:</p>
        <h4>Is Your Assessment Defensible?</h4>
        <p>Is your assessment reliable and valid? If a test is reliable, that means you can give that same test to several groups of people and get the same results from each group. For example, if you give your test to group A and they have an average score of 75%, then you give the same test to group B, and they have an average score of 25%, that means your test is not reliable. If a test is valid, on the other hand, that means that it's measuring what it's meant to measure. If you create a test that intends to measure if someone knows how to bake cookies, but the questions only ask about the ingredients needed, that's not a valid test (it's not measuring if someone knows how to bake cookies, it's measuring if they know the ingredients needed to bake cookies).</p>
        <p>	A test can be reliable, but not valid. I think our annual compliance training is guilty of this. Everyone gets 100%. In other words, everyone is scoring the same (it's reliable), but we donâ€™t' know if they actually learned anything (they're easy questions designed "just to prove that you paid attention").</p>
        <h4>When Should You Assess Learning?</h4>
        <p>	Should learning be assessed right after learning? Should it be a few days after learning? Or, should it follow some kind of 30/60/90 day plan? Ideally, it should be all 3 of these. Testing right after learning gives you an idea of how much your learners understood. Testing a few days after checks if they retained it. And testing long-term checks if they retained the information long-term (and if they're still using it).</p>
        <h4>How to Decide What to Assess?</h4>
        <p>Ask yourself, is it a nice to know, or a must know? Consider the size and depth of a particular section of the training. The larger and more in-depth the section is, the more questions should be dedicated to it. Homogeneity - are there things in a particular section of training that require the same knowledge and skills? If so, they don't need to be re-tested. Consider the consequences of not knowing that knowledge or skill. The higher the stakes, the more comprehensive the testing should be. Finally, consider the resources available during testing. The more reference information that's available to the learner, the most comprehensive the testing should be.</p>
        <h4>How to Assess Learning?</h4>
        <p>	There are 6 levels of assessment that go from basic to advanced. The more advanced the assessment method, the better job it does of actually testing learning:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Knowledge - recalling simple facts, terms, and simple concepts</li>
            <li>Comprehension - organizing  and comparing information and giving descriptions</li>
            <li>Application - solving problems by applying what you learned</li>
            <li>Analysis - examine and break down information into distinct parts by identifying motives or causes and making inferences</li>
            <li>Synthesis - compiling information together in a different way by combining elements in a new pattern</li>
            <li>Evaluation - presenting opinions by making judgments about information and validating ideas or quality of work based on a set of criteria</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>What Question Types to Use?</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Scenario based decisions (these can be multiple choice or fill in the blank)</li>
            <li>Simulations (can be multiple choice, direct observation, or interview/survey)</li>
            <li>Real world experience (observation or interview/survey)</li>
            <li>True/False - the presenter argues that these should basically never be used as they don't have much validity</li>
            <li>Matching/Multiple choice - these can be used, but don't use "select all that apply"</li>
            <li>Fill in the blank/Short answer - these are good, but keep in mind, they can be difficult to grade</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The presenter suggested reading an eLearning Guild paper titled "Writing Assessments to Validate the Impact of Learning." Reach out to me if you're interested in reading it.</p>
