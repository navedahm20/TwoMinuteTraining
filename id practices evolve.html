        <h3>ID Practices That Need To Evolve</h3>
        <p>There are a couple of practices that we're involved in that the presenters argued, must evolve. These two practices are: how we use metrics and how we analyze problems.</p>
    <h4 class="secondary-color">How We Use Metrics</h4>
    <p>When we think about using metrics, what do we usually think of? Typically, we develop a learning solution, then we check to see if team member performance improved, and then we check to see if it impacted the business (that is, if we even get to that point).</p>
    <p>The presenters argued that we need to actually do this in reverse order. We should begin by analyzing business metrics. These are things like costs, revenue, market share, volume, and speed. Then, we can look at performance metrics. These are productivity measures and, excuse my french, key performance indicators (remember those?). Then, we can start to develop our learning solution metrics. These are defined as indicators that the learning solution had some kind of impact on the performance metrics.</p>
    <p>What exactly is meant  by "indicators of impact" for a learning solution. They would be the answers to the following questions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Are the right people using the solution in the right context?</li>
      <li>Is the solution readily available when it's needed?</li>
      <li>Is it easy to use?</li>
      <li>Is it relevant and helpful?</li>
      <li>Are enough people using it?</li>
      <li>How is it affecting team/business metrics?</li>
    </ul>
    <h4 class="secondary-color">How We Analyze Problems</h4>
    <p class="short-margin">The presenters argue that we shouldn't be doing a "training analysis," rather, we should be doing a "performance analysis" (because ultimately, our end goal is to improve performance, not simply create a "really awesome" training). Here's a visual representation of the process they suggest for doing a performance analysis:</p>
