        <h3>Explaining Learning Ecosystems</h3>
        <p>For some time now, this concept of creating a learning and performance ecosystem has been gaining traction. The argument here is that "training" really only gives team members baseline proficiency. After that they're pretty much on their own. When you have a learning and performance ecosystem you allow team members to perform better by connecting them to a range of content, processes, and technologies. Here's a visual representation of what a learning ecosystem looks like:</p>

        <ol>
            <li><span class='secondary-color'>Talent Management</span> - This branch of the ecosystem is about helping team members improve in their current role as well as developing them for new roles.</li>
            <li><span class='secondary-color'>Performance Support</span> - These are tools and technologies that help team members make decisions and complete tasks in their workflow.</li>
            <li><span class='secondary-color'>Knowledge Management</span> - The ability to easily look up information in the moment of need.</li>
            <li><span class='secondary-color'>Access to Experts</span> - This enables team members to ask questions and get guidance.</li>
            <li><span class='secondary-color'>Social Network & Collaboration</span> - Provides the opportunity for team members to discuss experiences and exchange ideas.</li>
            <li><span class='secondary-color'>Structured Learning</span> - Gives team members the opportunity to gain new knowledge and develop skills. It's also necessary to meet compliance requirements.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Based on my perspective (which is certainly limited), I'd say we're doing a pretty good job with knowledge management (Jarvis) and structured learning (the bulk of what we do is classroom training and CBT's). I'd say we have a lot of room for improvement in all the other branches of the ecosystem. I think this model is something we should consider as a sort of roadmap to guide us on which projects and initiatives we take on. There's a whitepaper that goes into much more depth on this subject if you're interested in reading it (though it is pretty lengthy). Message me on Teams if you'd like to read it.</p>
