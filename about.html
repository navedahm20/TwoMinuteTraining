        <h3>What's This About?</h3>
        <p>Hi there! My name is Naved. I've been in the instructional design business for 7 years. I read quite a few books and articles on instructional design stuff and I attend quite a few conferences both in person and online. I also take notes furiously. I had the idea to take my notes and condense them into quick little nuggets of information. Then, take those little nuggets and share them with anyone interested in learning some fundamental ID concepts. So, I built this website.</p>
        <h4>Why Two Minute Training?</h4>
        <p>We live in a time of instant access and short attention spans (if you're an instructional designer, then you know this better than most). My goal with every article I post is to ensure that you can read through it in two minutes or less.</p>
