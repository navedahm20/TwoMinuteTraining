        <h3>Explaining Behavioral Engineering</h3>
        <p>Ultimately our goal as trainers - I mean, problem solvers - is to change behavior (specifically that behavior which will improve performance). How do we do that? The process that <i>this</i> presenter suggested is very similar to the one discussed a couple posts ago. Take a look:</p>
        <img src="/img/Artboard 1.png" alt="graphic showing how learning solutions should be developed">
        <p>Just like in the previous model, we must first define the <span class="secondary-color-italic">business goals</span>. This allows us to identify the <span class="secondary-color-italic">behavior change</span> which, in turn, determines the <span class="secondary-color-italic">learning solution</span>. Implementing the learning solution induces a behavior change, which impacts the business goal.</p>
        <p>When we're developing a learning solution, there are 3 questions we must ask about the learner:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Do they have the <span class="secondary-color-italic">knowledge</span> to change their behavior?</li>
            <li>Do they have the <span class="secondary-color-italic">opportunity</span> to change their behavior?</li>
            <li>Do they have the <span class="secondary-color-italic">motivation</span> to change their behavior?</li>
        </ol>
        <p>If the answer to the first question is no, <i>that</i> can potentially be addressed by a learning solution. The second and third questions <i>cannot</i> be addressed by a learning solution (not directly, at least), but they're just as important to consider. Even if you develop an effective learning solution (that gives learners the knowledge to change their behavior), if they don't have the opportunity or motivation to change, you will not see any behavior change.</p>
        <p>Let's consdier a simple example. Let's say you have a team of call center representatives. When they get a complaint from a client, they're <i>supposed</i> to transfer the call to your client relations team, but what you're observing is that they are transferring calls to the sales team. So, you develop this amazing training course to teach them how to properly transfer the calls to client relations. You assess the learners and find that they all know how to do this process correctly. However, you notice that they're still transferring calls to the sales team. Now, when you begin to consider <i>opportunity</i> and <i>motivation</i>, you dig a little deeper and learn that your call center representatives are financially rewarded for every call that they transfer to the sales team. In this example, your call center representatives lack the <span class="secondary-color-italic">motivation</span> to transfer calls to anybody except the sales team. Now, this is a very simplified example, but it's just to illustrate the importance of considering opportuinty and motivation in addition to knowledge, when you're developing a learning solution.</p>
